1. Client Uptime Report: Automated Data-Driven Evidence Based Pipeline for SitusAMC Applications

Build unified ingestion pipelines (CloudWatch Synthetics, Lambda, S3) to continuously capture uptime and SLO metrics across acuity, strata, centricity, VmsNext.

Define application-specific SLOs, automate alerting thresholds, and validate with synthetic downtime tests.

Generate automated evidence reports (QuickSight/HTML/PDF) and deliver securely to clients for SLA compliance.

Provide executive-level dashboards mapping uptime directly to contractual obligations for transparent client reviews.

2. Migration from DataDog to AWS CloudWatch for Cost Saving and Observability Alternate

Inventory and translate all DataDog dashboards, logs, and alerts into CloudWatch equivalents with OpenTelemetry support.

Implement CloudWatch agent/log pipelines, optimize retention policies, and configure alarms to reduce costs while maintaining observability.

Run parallel monitoring for validation, then cut over teams (acuity, strata, centricity, VmsNext) to CloudWatch and decommission DataDog.

Deliver cost-savings analysis and conduct training sessions for engineering and business stakeholders to ensure adoption.
