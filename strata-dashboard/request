While working on the migration from Datadog to AWS CloudWatch, we realized that the dashboards alone donâ€™t give us enough detail to identify and compare the underlying resources.

To make this process smoother and more accurate, could you please share the queries, filters, or any detailed configurations used in those dashboards? Having that information would really help us verify and align the metrics properly in CloudWatch.
